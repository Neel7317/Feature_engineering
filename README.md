# Feature_engineering:
In this Repository i am cover almost all the technique comes under Feature Engineering

  (1) EDA
  
  (2) Handling OutLiers: with both Normal and Skewed data 
  
  (3) Handling Imbalanced Dataset: Under Sampling, Over Sampling, SOMTETomek
    
  (4) Feature Engineering : In this file i am deal with concepts as below
  
      -- Categorical Encoding: (i) Nominal Encoding: one hot encoding, One hot encoding with many Categorical feature, Mean Encoding, Count/Frequency Encoding
                               (ii) Ordinal Encoding : Label encoding, Target Guided Encoding
      
      -- All the techniques of handling ,Missing values
                                (i) Mean/ Median/Mode replacement
                                (ii) Random Sample Imputation
                                (iii) Capturing NAN values with a new feature
                                (iv) End of Distribution imputation
                                (V) Arbitrary imputation
                                (vi) Frequent categories imputation
                                
      -- Normalization & Standardization 
                                (i) Standard Scaling
                                (ii) Scaling to Minimum And Maximum values
                                (iii) Scaling To Median And Quantiles or Robust Scaler
                                (iv) Guassian Transformation or Normal Distribution: Logarithmic transformation, Reciprocal transformation, Square root transformation,
                                                                                     exponential transformation (more general, you can use any exponent),
                                                                                     boxcox transformation
